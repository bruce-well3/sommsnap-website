            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="date">Last updated: January 2025</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>SommSnap ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("SommSnap" or the "App").</p>

            <p>By using SommSnap, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
            <p><strong>Phone Number:</strong> We require your phone number for SMS-based authentication. This allows you to securely access your account and sync your wine preferences across devices. Your phone number is stored securely with Firebase Authentication and is used as your unique identifier.</p>

            <h3>2. Wine Data and Preferences</h3>
            <p>We collect and store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scan History:</strong> Wine lists, bottles, shelves, and party scans you perform</li>
                <li><strong>Wine Preferences:</strong> Your saved favorites, ratings, and taste preferences</li>
                <li><strong>Dining Companion Profiles:</strong> Names and wine preferences of companions you create</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data (Optional):</strong> If you grant permission, we use your location to detect venues and provide location-based recommendations. You can disable this in iOS Settings at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Camera and Photos</h3>
            <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> SommSnap requires camera access to scan wine lists, bottles, and shelves.
